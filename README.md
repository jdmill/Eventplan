# Eventplan

## Overview

Our group created an easy to use, user-friendly way to see local events in their desired location.
Using parameters users are able to search by location, music genre, age-restriction, and time of day. Weather is also displayed to give a heads up of how to prepare for their outing. 

This was a collaborative effort where we utilized git hub to merge branches to implement features and resolve conflicts. APIs were used to gather data and plenty of client-side javascript was used to give functionality to the site. 

## User Story

```

I WANT to see events I would like in my desired location

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with events for that city

WHEN I choose a date, if it is with the forecast range
THEN I am presented with weather for that day in the form of the Temp and an ICON
