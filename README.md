# Eventplan

## Overview

Our group created an easy to use, user-friendly way to see local events in their desired location.
Using parameters users are able to search by location, music genre, age-restriction, and time of day. Weather is also displayed to give a heads up of how to prepare for their outing. 

This was a collaborative effort where we utilized git hub to merge branches to implement features and resolve conflicts. APIs were used to gather data and plenty of client-side javascript was used to give functionality to the site. 

## User Story

```
AS a music lover
I WANT to see events I would like in my desired location
SO THAT I can plan for a fun outing
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with events for that city
WHEN I choose an option like Genre or Time Of Day
Then the presented results change accordingly
WHEN I choose a date, if it is with the forecast range
THEN I am presented with weather for that day in the form of the Temp and an ICON
```
## Feature breakdown and description
```
Search Functionality
*By Location
*By Time
*By Date

Weather Information
*Provides weather information if within forecast range - "Within 5 days of present date"

Accessibility
*Mobile Responsive Design
*Links provided to TicketMaster box office for every presented event
```

 We implemented some features that make our website accessible and easy to navigate for every user.
 Using the search bar will assist the user in choosing the desired location for an event they would like to attend
 We added filter tags that will make picking out the the event the user will like to attend to much easier.
 The filters are time related, so the users will be able to decide when and which event they are interested in.
 Each time you search a certain location, the weather for that day will display, so it will help the user plan out their day.
 If the user wants to see an artist/band a specific day, users can use the calendar feature to book future concerts.
 Once the user finds the perfect event they would like to attend, there is a button that will link the user to ticketmaster.com, once there the user can purchase their tickets.
 Our website is also mobile

## Future Updates
Possible Future Updates:
While working on this project we were unable to implement all the initial design features we planned to create.

We intend to include:
*Genre Search
*More detailed weather reports
*Longer Forecast
*Better result filters
*And much, much, more!
